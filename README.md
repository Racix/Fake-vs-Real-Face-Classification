# Fake-vs-Real-Face-Classification

## Intro
This is a project where we proform a classification of real and fake faces. We do it by using Convolutional neural network (CNN) and further explore the compatibility of the algorithm with dataset we make use of several CNN archeturs, namely Lenet and Densenet.
